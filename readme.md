  A secure, transparent, and blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform built with React, Solidity, and Hardhat.Block Fund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It empowers users to create and support campaigns using smart contracts, ensuring **transparency**, **security**, and **trust** through blockchain technology and Block Fund is a full-stack decentralized crowdfunding platform that integrates modern web technologies with blockchain. Built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Ethereum smart contracts, it allows users to seamlessly launch and contribute to campaigns in a trustless and transparent environment. The frontend connects to MetaMask for wallet authentication, while the backend stores off-chain data securely. On the blockchain side, Solidity smart contracts manage the creation, funding, and withdrawal logic of campaigns, ensuring immutability and fairness. Block Fund serves as a modern, Web3 alternative to platforms like GoFundMe, empowering creators and contributors to interact without intermediaries.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity and is located in the `src/contracts/BlockFund.sol` file. It handles the core functionality of the platform, including:

- Campaign creation
- Contribution management
- Fund withdrawal by campaign creators

### Example Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BlockFund {
    struct Campaign {
        address payable creator;
        uint goal;
        uint raisedAmount;
        uint deadline;
        bool completed;
    }

    mapping(uint => Campaign) public campaigns;
    uint public campaignCount;

    function createCampaign(uint _goal, uint _duration) public {
        campaignCount++;
        campaigns[campaignCount] = Campaign(
            payable(msg.sender),
            _goal,
            0,
            block.timestamp + _duration,
            false
        );
    }

    function contribute(uint _campaignId) public payable {
        Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[_campaignId];
        require(block.timestamp < campaign.deadline, "Campaign ended");
        require(!campaign.completed, "Campaign completed");

        campaign.raisedAmount += msg.value;
        if (campaign.raisedAmount >= campaign.goal) {
            campaign.completed = true;
        }
    }

    function withdrawFunds(uint _campaignId) public {
        Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[_campaignId];
        require(msg.sender == campaign.creator, "Not campaign creator");
        require(block.timestamp > campaign.deadline, "Campaign not ended");

        campaign.creator.transfer(campaign.raisedAmount);
    }
}
```
